Mongoose provides two types of triggers: 
pre and post hooks. 
These are functions that are executed before or after certain events occur, 
such as saving or updating a document.
To add a pre-save hook, you use the pre('save') middleware. T
he following code shows an example of a pre-save hook that logs the document before it is saved:

schema.pre('save', function() {
    /do some
  console.log(this);
});


why we need index in dbms
Indexing in DBMS is a technique that uses data structures to improve the performance of a database.
It helps to optimize the searching time of a database query, and makes database performance better

Indexes support efficient execution of queries in MongoDB.
Without indexes, MongoDB must scan every document in a collection to return query results. 
If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB uses the index to limit the number of documents it must scan.

Although indexes improve query performance, adding an index has negative performance impact for write operations. 
For collections with a high write-to-read ratio, indexes are expensive because each insert must also update any indexes.
